# Active Context: Browser-based Snake Game (MVP)

## Current Work Focus
The MVP Snake Game app is now fully scaffolded and implemented in the src/ directory. The app is being served locally using Python's HTTP server at http://localhost:5173. All core modules (game logic, rendering, input, main entry) and UI are in place.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented all MVP features in src/
- Set up local static server for development
- Game is accessible and playable in browser

## Next Steps
- Test gameplay and fix any bugs
- Ensure accessibility and browser compatibility
- Polish UI and code as needed

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Focus on MVP completeness and browser compatibility
- Use Python HTTP server for local development

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Modular ES6+ codebase
- Clear separation of logic, rendering, and input

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Local static server is a simple, effective solution for browser-based games
- Early modularization aids maintainability
