# Progress: Browser-based Snake Game (MVP)

## What Works
- App runs and is accessible at http://localhost:5173
- All MVP features implemented (game loop, input, collision, scoring, restart)
- Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) implemented and tested
- UI and accessibility features in place
- Application works in Chrome, Brave, and Edge browsers

## What's Left to Build
- Further user testing and browser compatibility checks (Safari)
- Bug fixes and polish

## Known Issues and Limitations
- favicon.ico 404 (non-critical)
- Further testing needed for edge cases and accessibility

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Adopted Python HTTP server for local development
- Maintained focus on modular, accessible MVP
- Added difficulty levels for replay value and accessibility
