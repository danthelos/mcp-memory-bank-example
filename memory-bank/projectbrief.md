# Project Brief: Browser-based Snake Game (MVP)

## Overview
A minimal, fully playable Snake game for modern browsers, focusing only on essential features for core gameplay.

## Core Requirements
- Initialize a snake of length 3 at the center of a 20×20 grid
- Spawn one food item at a random empty cell
- Implement a core game loop updating every 150 ms
- Handle keyboard controls (arrow keys/WASD), disallowing 180° reversals
- Detect collisions with walls or self and trigger game over
- Display current score and a "Game Over" overlay with restart functionality
- Ensure compatibility with the latest two major versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari

## Goals
- Deliver a minimal, bug-free, and fully playable Snake game
- Provide a responsive and accessible user experience
- Maintain clean separation of game logic and rendering using ES6+ modules

## Project Scope
In Scope:
- All features required for a functional MVP Snake game as described above
